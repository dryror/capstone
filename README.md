### Long Term Ecological Monitoring Application

LTEMA streamlines the process of collecting ground cover observations for BC Parks and the LTEM environmental monitoring protocols. Developed using Titanium and targeting the iPad, the application replaces the current pen-and-paper method of recording observations.

#### Key Features
- validates input on-site and in real-time
- searches multiple taxonomy levels simultaneously
- integrates GPS and camera into the site survey process
- exports data and linked photos in one bundle
- pre-populates a revisted site with static measurements
